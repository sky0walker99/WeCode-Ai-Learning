# WeCode-Ai-Learning-Assistant

# GENAI powered teaching assistant

An AI-based tool designed to help users learn complex topics such as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The assistant primarily utilizes the Socratic method of questioning but also includes alternative learning techniques. These techniques can be customized by the user to suit their learning style.


## Features

- Multiple Learning Methods:
    - Socratic Method
    - Feynman Technique
    - User-defined custom learning methods
- Dynamic User Expertise Level:
    - The model can gauge the userâ€™s expertise level and adjust its responses accordingly.
- User Interaction:
    - Users can choose their preferred teaching methods and create their own.



## Learning Techniques

- Socratic Method: Engages users by asking guided questions to deepen understanding.
- Feynman Technique: Simplifies complex ideas to basic concepts, ensuring full comprehension.
- Customizable Methods: Users can design their own teaching methods tailored to their learning style.
## AI Model Architecture

The system relies on a multi-layered model structure that adapts its responses dynamically
